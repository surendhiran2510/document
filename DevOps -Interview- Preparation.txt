This article describes how to use and install the Artifactory Repository Manager.

1. Artifactory Repository Manager
1.1. What is a Repository Manager?
A repository manager allows to store and retrieve build artifacts. You can use a repository manager to retrieve your code dependencies, for example during a Gradle or Maven build. The most popular examples for repository manager are Maven Central Repository and jcenter at Bintray.

1.2. What is Artifactory?
An Artifactory installation brings such a repository for your company. So you can host your own repositories, but also use Artifactory as a proxy for public repositories. With such a proxy the time to receive an artifact is reduced and it saves ﻿bandwidth. Artifactory allows you to host your private build artifacts.

Artifactory is avaalable as a commercial version and as an Open Source distribution.


Extensive Metadata
Artifactory provides full metadata for all major package formats for both artifacts and folders. These include metadata that originates with the package itself, custom metadata added by users such as searchable properties and metadata that is automatically generated by tools such as build information and more.
